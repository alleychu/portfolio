        The journey of digital transformation is never easy. Thus implementing
        digital twin products in business takes a bit of a chance. In 2021, we
        got a precious opportunity to work with the biggest Insurance company in
        Taiwan as their pioneer project adopting a Building Management System
        (BMS) for operation management. We built a platform with functions
        including facility information, alarm reporting, CCTV alarming, facility
        location mapping, as well as indoor environment and energy monitoring.
        Partner with a hardware company, there were a lot of valuable insights
        and lessons learned during the IT & OT integration process. I’m grateful
        for having the experience of leading this project and building the
        platform from concept to launch.
